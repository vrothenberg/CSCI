OUTPUTS (testing will expect outputs to match EXACTLY)

OUTPUT                     : operation / notes

MUST CREATE TREE INSTANCE  : any operation executed when dynamic tree is nullptr
                           : * with the exception of C (create)

TREE CREATED               : C / if an instance already exists, delete it first
TREE CLEARED               : X
TREE DELETED               : D / and set the pointer to nullptr

WORD w INCREMENTED         : I w / if w is already in the tree
WORD w INSERTED            : I w / if w is NOT already in the tree

FOUND w                    : F w / replace w with the string
or w NOT FOUND
or TREE EMPTY

REMOVED w                  : R w / replace w with the string
or w NOT FOUND
or TREE EMPTY

GOT w count                : G w / w is the string, count is the counter value
or w NOT FOUND

TREE SIZE IS n             : N / replace n with tree size

************************************************************************************
* For in order print (O) and reverse order print (E):

TREE EMPTY                 : if tree is empty
or output the words in ascending order, including their count (separated by a space), one entry per line

example:

apple 3
banana 2
cherry 4
