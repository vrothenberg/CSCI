MUST CREATE LIST INSTANCE  : any operation executed when dynamic list is nullptr
                           : * with the exception of C (create)

LIST CLEARED               : X
LIST DELETED               : D / and set the pointer to nullptr
VALUE n INSERTED           : I n / replace n with the value
VALUE n ADDED TO HEAD      : F n / replace n with the value
VALUE n ADDED TO TAIL      : B n / replace n with the value

VALUE n ELIMINATED
or VALUE n NOT FOUND       : E n / replace n with the value

VALUE n REMOVED
or VALUE n NOT FOUND       : R n / replace n with the value

VALUE n FOUND
or VALUE n NOT FOUND       : G n / replace n with the value

VALUE n AT HEAD
or LIST EMPTY              : A / replace n with the value

VALUE n AT TAIL
or LIST EMPTY              : Z / replace n with the value

REMOVED HEAD
or LIST EMPTY              : T

REMOVED TAIL
or LIST EMPTY              : K

LIST SIZE IS n             : N / replace n with list size

n1,n2,n3,...
or LIST EMPTY              : P / replace n1,n2,n3,... with values from list
