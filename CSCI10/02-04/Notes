Computer Architecture

Functionality - Primary for CS
Organization - Secondary for CS
Implementation - Mostly for Computer / Electrical Engineers

[Instruction Set] Architecture (ISA) - Functionality, Most relevant for CS
Microarchitecture - Implementation
Systems Design - Implementation and Organization

ISA
Addressing - Pointers.  Different modes. & direct address, * indirect address.
Data Types - Sizes / amounts.  ARM is 32 bit.
Memory - RAM
Registers - A form of memory.

add r0,r1,r2
    r0=r1+r2

CISC - Use more complicated circuitry and often more electricity
RISC - Simpler to implement, though can end up doing more instructions to do more complex instructions

ARM - RISC, reduced instruction set computer
Intel x86 - Some CISC, complex instruction set computer
RISC-V

Common types of instructions
Arithmetic/logic
Data handling and memory
Control flow - Conditional statements, jumps, branches.
Coprocessor - Can handle floating point or arithmetic.  Not multiple cores.

SoC - System on a chip.
