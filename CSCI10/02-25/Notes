Hardware

On-chip debugging: Control execution of code step by step, inspect registers and memory.

Programming: Burning the compiled code onto the hardware's flash memory (EEPROM).
ROM (read only memory) doesn't change.
Variables go in RAM, volatile memory.

ST-LINK, ST Micro's technology which implements on chip debugging and programming.
Connects via USB which also provides power.
